#constructor overloading - jab program me do ya dos e zyda construcotr hai but unker paramter different hai.
polymorphism ka example hai constructor overloading


this pointer ka use tab karte hai jab class ke data member aur function me pass kiye paramter ke name same hai
taki confusion na ho data member konsa hai aur parmaeter kon hai.


copy constructor ka kam hota hai ek object ki properties copy krke dusre object me dal dena.
